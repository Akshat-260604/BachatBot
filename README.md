## üéØ The Problem: Financial Complexity in India

The Indian financial landscape is a maze of complex products and dense jargon. This leads to:
*   **Poor Planning**: 60% of middle-income earners live paycheck to paycheck, with 45% failing to optimize taxes.
*   **Missed Opportunities**: A significant number of taxpayers overlook major tax-saving options under sections 80C, 80D, 24B, and NPS.
*   **Ineffective Tracking**: 70% of salaried individuals struggle to track expenses, hindering their ability to build wealth.

## ‚ú® Our Solution: An Intelligent Financial Co-Pilot

BachatBot is an AI-powered system designed to be the ultimate financial co-pilot. It understands financial documents, automates data analysis, and offers hyper-personalized tax-saving and investment advice, all within a secure and user-friendly platform.

### Core Features:
-   **ü§ñ AI Document Intelligence**: Securely upload financial documents. Our AI pipeline intelligently analyzes the document's content, extracts key data points, and structures them for further use, eliminating manual entry.
-   **üí¨ Intelligent Tax Chatbot (RAG-Powered)**: Ask complex questions about Indian tax law in plain English. Our chatbot uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to provide accurate, context-aware answers from a specialized knowledge base.
-   **üí∏ Dual-Regime Tax Calculator & Advisor**: Input your financial data to see a real-time, side-by-side comparison of your tax liability under the Old and New Indian tax regimes.
-   **üìà Personalized AI Reports**: Generate comprehensive financial reports with actionable investment and tax-saving strategies, powered by Google Gemini.
-   **üîí Secure User Authentication & Profile Management**: A complete auth system with JWT, email verification, and a detailed user profile manager.

## üìä The Impact: Tangible Financial Benefits

Our solution translates directly into measurable savings for the user.
> In a country where the average income of a middle-class family in a metropolitan area is ‚Çπ35,000, BachatBot can help users save approximately **‚Çπ15,000 upfront** and **‚Çπ8,000 per year** by providing AI-driven financial insights at a fraction of the cost of a traditional advisor. This represents a potential saving of **22.8% of income**.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

BachatBot employs a robust microservices architecture, separating the frontend presentation layer from the specialized AI/ML backend services. This design ensures scalability, maintainability, and resilience.

## üî¨ Technical Deep Dive

Our implementation showcases a modern, full-stack approach to building AI applications.

#### 1. Frontend: A Modern, Reactive Experience
-   **Framework**: Built with **Next.js 15** and the App Router, leveraging Server Components for performance and Client Components for interactivity.
-   **State Management**: **Redux Toolkit** is used for global state management (e.g., sidebar state), ensuring a predictable and scalable state container.
-   **UI & Styling**: **Tailwind CSS 4** with `tailwind-merge` and `clsx` for a utility-first, conflict-free styling experience. Custom fonts (`ClashDisplay`, `Montserrat`) are loaded via `next/font`.
-   **Animations**: **Framer Motion** is used extensively to create fluid page transitions and micro-interactions, enhancing the user experience.
-   **File Handling**: `react-dropzone` provides a seamless drag-and-drop interface for document uploads.

#### 2. Backend API Gateway & Authentication
-   **Gateway Pattern**: The Next.js API Routes (`/src/app/api`) act as a secure gateway (Backend-for-Frontend), proxying requests to the downstream Python microservices. This simplifies CORS and centralizes API interaction logic.
-   **Authentication**: Secure, token-based authentication is implemented using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** and `bcrypt.js` for password hashing.
-   **Session Management**: JWTs are stored in `HttpOnly` cookies for enhanced security against XSS attacks.
-   **Protected Routes**: The `middleware.js` file intercepts requests to protected pages (`/dashboard`, `/profile`), verifying the JWT cookie before allowing access and redirecting unauthenticated users.

#### 3. AI/ML Microservices (Python, Flask)
-   **Document Intelligence Service**: This microservice is responsible for processing uploaded financial documents. It leverages a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) like **Google Gemini** to understand the context and content of the document, extracting key financial data (like income, expenses, investments) and converting it into a structured JSON format.
-   **RAG Tax Chatbot Service (`/PlakshaChatbot`)**: A Flask-based service that implements a classic Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline.
    -   **Indexing**: Tax law PDFs are loaded using `PyPDFLoader`, split into chunks, and vectorized using **Hugging Face Embeddings** (`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
    -   **Storage**: The vectors are stored and indexed in a **FAISS** vector store for fast semantic search.
    -   **Retrieval**: On receiving a query, the service retrieves the most relevant document chunks from FAISS.
    -   **Generation**: The retrieved context and the user's query are passed to an LLM (**OpenAI/Gemini**) via **LangChain** to generate a contextually accurate answer.
-   **Tax & Recommendation Service (`/PlakshaRec`)**: A Flask service that exposes a `/generate-report` endpoint. It contains the business logic to calculate tax liabilities for both Old and New regimes and then queries the **Google Gemini** API with a structured prompt to generate personalized financial and investment insights.

```bash
# .env (example)

# MongoDB Connection String
MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster.mongodb.net/authDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

# JWT Secret for Authentication
JWT_SECRET="this-is-a-very-strong-and-long-secret-key-for-jwt-signing"

# External API Keys for AI Services
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_gemini_api_key"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"

# Email Service for Verification
RESEND_API_KEY="your_resend_api_key"
```

### 2. Installation & Running the App

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/bachatbot.git
    cd bachatbot
    ```

2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install

    *(Repeat for all relevant Python service directories.)*

4.  **Start the Backend Services:**
    Open separate terminals for each service, activate their environments, and run them. They are configured to run on different ports.
    ```bash
    # Terminal 1: Chatbot Service (Port 5000)
    cd PlakshaChatbot && source venv/bin/activate && python app.py

    # Terminal 2: Recommendation Service (Port 7000)
    cd PlakshaRec && source venv/bin/activate && python app.py
    ```

5.  **Start the Frontend:**
    In a new terminal at the project root:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
